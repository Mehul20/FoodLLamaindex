# MehulFoodBlogAI

AI agent that can answer questions based on my personal food blog - https://food.mehulrastogi.com/

## Steps
- Clone this repository
- Create a .env file, and add this line ``` OPENAI_API_KEY = <Your OpenAI API key> ```
- Change the question on line 22 of ```starter.py```
- ```response = query_engine.query("Add your question here?")```
- Run ```python3 starter.py``` from the command line to get the output

I'll continute to update the CSV file in this repository.
